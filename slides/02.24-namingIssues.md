* [893: 1.1 Combobox pattern endorses unlabelled form fields](https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/893)
* [909: Clarify combobox label placement](https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/909)
* [1046: Does combobox require an accessible name?](https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/1046)

<hr>

* May 2019 F2F issue 893 discussion:
    * Name all 3 parts and move aria- expanded to textbox
    * Would be "bug fixes", not a new pattern
* 909 is duplicate of 893.
* 1.2 proposal resolves all 3:
    * No wrapper naming
    * The textbox is the combobox and requires a name
    * Controlled pop-up explicitly named by author (may reference combobox with aria-labelledby)
