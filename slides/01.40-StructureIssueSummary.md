## ARIA 1.0

* Popup is owned (and thus inside of) the textbox.
* The popup is thus not perceivable in screen reader reading modes.

## ARIA 1.2

* Combobox element is non-focusable composite container (like a grid).
* Screen reader support:
    * Composite structure still not supported by screen readers.
    * JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and Narrator better support 1.0 than 1.1.
* Naming:
    * Naming the text input does not name the container and vice versa.
    * Separately naming all 3 parts adds complexity for both authors and screen readers.
* Container adds unnecessary complexity:
    * Does not correspond to anything visible in the UI.
    * Does not add value for screen reader users.
    * Like requiring a wrapper around a menu button and the menu it opens.
