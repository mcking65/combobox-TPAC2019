title: Summary of 1.2 Changes (PR 1051)
hide_toc: true

1. Revise definition of combobox to encompass implementations that do not support text editing, such as some implementations of the HTML select element by browsers.
2. Revise description of the structure of combobox so the element with the combobox role is the focused element instead of a wrapper that is not focusable and the relationship with the popup is defined by aria-controls.
3. Change the super class to input from select so it describes the actual structure; select is a composite and the revised combobox structure does not include any focusable descendants. This also has the beneficial side effect of removing aria-orientation, which is not applicable.
4. Add aria-activedescendant as a supported property because it is no longer inherrited from its super class.
5. Remove all required owned elements. A combobox no longer has any descendants.
6. Change section 2.3 (id="managingfocus") to remove combobox from the list of composite widgets and for clarity and compatibility with revised combobox structure.
7. Editorial revisions to the definition and description of the aria-activedescendant property to reflect the changes to the combobox structure.
