<input type="text" role="combobox" readonly>
~~~

## Conflicting information when announced

* User hears "read only edit combobox"
* readonly means you cannot change the value of an input
* In some implementations in the wild, it actually means:
    * User cannot type text in the textbox
    * User can navigate and select text in the textbox
    * User can change value with dropdown

## HTML Conflict

* Cannot use readonly and required
* Should `aria-required="true"` be valid when combined with HTML:readonly?

## Solution?

* How can we get readonly functionality of a text input without calling the combobox readonly?
